   <p class=About> 
   Reiki is a healing technique based on channelling energy into the patient.
    There are many beneficial effects of reiki including relaxation, feelings of peace and in some cases improvements in minor physical pains.
	It can aid stress and sleeping disorders as well as helping with emotional issues. The practice balances the energies in the body to promote self healing within.
	Reiki was rediscovered by a Japanese professor, Dr Mikao Usui in 1860's. 
	The method involves placing one's hands on or above the clients body to transfer the energy.

    Alison has been practicing Reiki for over 5years now and has passed Reiki 1, Reiki 2 and Reiki Mastery.
